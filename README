LevelSetup contains creating the levels and setting the board as well as the character assembly per level
Witch is a character that hits within two spaces and moves randomly throughout the board
Giant is a character that slowly patrols the map and if on the same space kills
Rainbow is the object that does nothing
PotOfGold is what gets one point
Leprechaun will advance to the next level
